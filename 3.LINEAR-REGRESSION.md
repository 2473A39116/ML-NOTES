# LINEAR REGRESSION : 
–	Equation linear regression : Y = M . X + B
–	Y represents dependent variable 
–	X represents independent variable 
–	M is the slope  of the line ( how much Y changes for a UNIT  change in X )
–	B is the intercept ( value of Y when X=0 )
–	Steps : 
 1. Data collection
 2. Calculations 
 3. Prediction 
 4. Visualization 
–	Ex : Predicting pizza prices
